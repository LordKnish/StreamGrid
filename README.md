  <h3>Your Streams, Your Layout, Your Way</h3>
</div>

StreamGrid revolutionizes multi-stream viewing by giving you complete freedom over your layout. Want a massive main stream surrounded by smaller feeds? Or five equally-sized streams? Or any other arrangement you can imagine? StreamGrid makes it possible. Built with Electron, React, and TypeScript, it's the perfect solution for watching multiple streams exactly the way you want.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Option 1: Download Pre-built Application (Recommended)

1. Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/LordKnish/StreamGrid/releases) section
2. Download the latest version for your platform:
   - **Windows**: `streamgrid-1.2.0-setup.exe`
   - **macOS**: `streamgrid-1.2.0.dmg`
   - **Linux**: `streamgrid-1.2.0.AppImage`
3. Install and run StreamGrid

### Option 2: Build from Source

#### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18.x or higher
- npm 9.x or higher
- **FFmpeg** (required for RTSP streaming support)

##### Installing FFmpeg

**Windows:**
1. Download FFmpeg from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
2. Extract to `C:\ffmpeg`
3. Add `C:\ffmpeg\bin` to your system PATH
4. Or use Chocolatey: `choco install ffmpeg`

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

**Linux (Fedora/RHEL):**
```bash
sudo yum install ffmpeg
```

#### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LordKnish/StreamGrid.git
cd StreamGrid
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Run in development mode** (for testing/development)
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. **Build the application** (for production)
```bash
# Build for your current platform
npm run build

# Or build for specific platforms:
npm run build:win    # Windows
npm run build:mac    # macOS
npm run build:linux  # Linux
```

5. **Find your built application**
   - Windows: `dist/streamgrid-1.2.0-setup.exe`
   - macOS: `dist/streamgrid-1.2.0.dmg`
   - Linux: `dist/streamgrid-1.2.0.AppImage`

## 📹 RTSP Stream Support

StreamGrid supports RTSP (Real Time Streaming Protocol) streams from IP cameras, security systems, and other RTSP sources.

### Requirements
- FFmpeg must be installed on your system (see installation instructions above)
- RTSP stream URL from your camera or source

### RTSP URL Format
```
rtsp://[username:password@]host[:port]/path
```

**Examples:**
```
rtsp://192.168.1.100:554/stream1
rtsp://admin:password@192.168.1.100/live
rtsps://secure-camera.example.com/stream
```

### How It Works
1. StreamGrid detects RTSP URLs automatically
2. FFmpeg transcodes the RTSP stream to HLS format in real-time
3. The HLS stream is served locally and played in the browser
4. Low latency (~2-3 seconds) with automatic retry on connection loss

### Adding an RTSP Stream
1. Click "Add Stream" button
2. Enter your RTSP URL in the Stream URL field
3. The app will show "RTSP stream (requires FFmpeg)" if detected
4. Add a name and optional logo
5. Click "Add Stream"

### Troubleshooting RTSP Streams

**"FFmpeg not installed" error:**
- Install FFmpeg using the instructions above
- Restart StreamGrid after installation
- Verify FFmpeg is in your system PATH: `ffmpeg -version`

**Stream fails to load:**
- Verify the RTSP URL is correct
- Check if authentication is required (username/password)
- Ensure your firewall allows RTSP connections
- Try using TCP transport: `rtsp://camera?tcp`

**High latency or buffering:**
- RTSP streams have inherent 2-3 second latency due to HLS transcoding
- Check your network connection to the camera
- Reduce the number of concurrent RTSP streams

**Stream stops after a while:**
- StreamGrid automatically retries failed streams (up to 3 times)
- Check camera timeout settings
- Verify network stability

### Performance Tips
- Limit concurrent RTSP streams to 3-4 for best performance
- Use wired network connection for cameras when possible
- Close unused RTSP streams to free resources
- RTSP transcoding uses ~100MB RAM per stream
