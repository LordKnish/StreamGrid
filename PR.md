# Pull Request: StreamGrid v1.2.0 - Performance Optimizations & Cross-Platform Build Support

## Title
feat: Major performance optimizations and cross-platform build support for StreamGrid v1.2.0

## Description

This PR introduces significant performance improvements and adds comprehensive cross-platform build support to StreamGrid. The changes focus on optimizing rendering performance, memory management, and enabling builds for Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms.

### 🎯 Key Improvements

1. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Removed artificial 3-second loading delay for instant app startup
   - Implemented virtual rendering for efficient grid display with large numbers of streams
   - Added player pooling system to reduce memory usage and improve stream switching
   - Introduced debounced state updates to reduce re-render frequency
   - Created web workers for offloading layout calculations
   - Added lazy loading for chat components
   - Implemented performance monitoring hooks for tracking metrics

2. **Cross-Platform Build Support**
   - Configured electron-builder for Windows, macOS, and Linux builds
   - Added support for multiple package formats:
     - Windows: NSIS installer (.exe)
     - macOS: DMG installer (.dmg)
     - Linux: AppImage, DEB, and RPM packages
   - Fixed TypeScript compilation errors preventing production builds
   - Added missing dependencies (terser) for JavaScript minification

3. **Enhanced Features**
   - Grid management system with save/load functionality
   - Import/export grid configurations
   - Local file support for streams (Issue #4)
   - Improved error handling and recovery
   - Better auto-save behavior (increased delay to 5 seconds)

### 📊 Performance Impact

- **Startup Time**: Reduced from ~3.5s to <0.5s (removed artificial delay)
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized through player pooling and proper cleanup
- **Rendering**: Virtual rendering enables smooth performance with 50+ streams
- **Bundle Size**: Code splitting reduces initial load size

### 🏗️ Technical Changes

#### New Components & Hooks
- `VirtualStreamGrid.tsx` - Optimized grid with viewport-based rendering
- `OptimizedStreamCard.tsx` - Memoized stream card with player pooling
- `LazyChat.tsx` - Lazy-loaded chat component
- `usePerformanceMonitor.ts` - Performance tracking utilities
- `usePlayerPool.ts` - Video player resource management
- `useDebouncedStore.ts` - Debounced state updates
- `useLayoutWorker.ts` - Web worker integration for layout calculations

#### Modified Core Components
- `App.tsx` - Removed loading delay, added performance monitoring
- `StreamGrid.tsx` - Integrated virtual rendering
- `StreamCard.tsx` - Optimized with memoization and player pooling
- `useStreamStore.ts` - Added debouncing and optimized selectors

#### Build Configuration
- Updated `electron-builder.yml` with Linux configuration
- Enhanced `package.json` with platform-specific build scripts
- Fixed TypeScript configuration for production builds

### 📦 Dependencies Added

  }
}
```

### 🧪 Testing

- Added comprehensive performance tests in `__tests__/performance.test.tsx`
- Validated virtual rendering with 100+ streams
- Tested memory usage patterns over extended periods
- Confirmed smooth 60fps during drag operations
- Successfully built and tested Windows installer (96.3 MB)

### 📝 Documentation

Created comprehensive build documentation:
