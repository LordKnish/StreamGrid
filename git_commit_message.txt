fix: resolve Linux build failures and improve release workflow

- Fix 7zip extraction error in Linux builds by using system fpm
- Add proper Debian package metadata (author email, maintainer)
- Install required system dependencies (ruby, build-essential, fpm)
- Clear electron-builder cache to prevent corruption
- Disable electron-builder publishing in favor of dedicated release job
- Add separate GitHub release job for better control and reliability
- Change release type from draft to release to avoid conflicts

The Linux build was failing with "ERROR: No more files" when electron-builder
tried to extract the fpm tool. This is resolved by installing fpm via Ruby
gems and using USE_SYSTEM_FPM=true environment variable.

All platform builds now use --publish never, with a dedicated release job
that creates a draft GitHub release with all artifacts attached.
